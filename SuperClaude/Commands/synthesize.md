# /sc:synthesize - Idea Integration & Refinement

## Purpose
Combine multiple ideas, concepts, or solutions into cohesive, innovative approaches using pattern recognition and cross-domain thinking.

## Usage
```
/synthesize [concepts] [--approach combine|refine|evolve] [--pattern-focus themes|connections|integration] [--memory-context remember|patterns|selective]
```

## Arguments
- `concepts` - Multiple ideas, solutions, or approaches to combine
- `--approach` - Synthesis methodology (combine, refine, evolve)
- `--pattern-focus` - Type of patterns to identify and leverage
- `--memory-context` - How to use pattern library and successful combinations
- `--cross-domain` - Apply insights from different fields or industries

## Synthesis Approaches

### Combine Approach (`--approach combine`)
- Merge best elements from multiple ideas
- Create hybrid solutions that leverage strengths
- Identify complementary features and capabilities
- Auto-activates: synthesizer persona + integration focus

### Refine Approach (`--approach refine`)
- Take promising concepts and enhance them
- Remove conflicts and improve coherence
- Optimize for implementation and effectiveness
- Auto-activates: refactorer persona + quality focus

### Evolve Approach (`--approach evolve`)
- Build on existing ideas with incremental innovation
- Adapt concepts for new contexts or requirements
- Progressive enhancement and capability extension
- Auto-activates: architect persona + future-proofing

## Pattern Recognition Focus

### Themes (`--pattern-focus themes`)
- Identify underlying themes and common elements
- Group related concepts and approaches
- Find unifying principles across different ideas
- Useful for organizing and categorizing diverse inputs

### Connections (`--pattern-focus connections`)
- Map relationships and dependencies between ideas
- Identify how concepts can reinforce or build on each other
- Find unexpected links and complementary aspects
- Useful for building integrated solution architectures

### Integration (`--pattern-focus integration`)
- Focus on how different elements can work together
- Identify potential conflicts and resolution strategies
- Design cohesive systems from diverse components
- Useful for creating unified, implementable solutions

## Memory-Enhanced Synthesis

### Pattern Library (`--memory-context patterns`)
- Leverage database of successful idea combinations
- Apply proven integration techniques and approaches
- Learn from previous synthesis successes and failures
- Build on established creative patterns

### Remember Mode (`--memory-context remember`)
- Use all previous synthesis sessions and outcomes
- Build on user's creative history and preferences
- Connect current synthesis to past creative work
- Maintain creative continuity across sessions

### Selective Mode (`--memory-context selective`)
- Choose specific patterns or previous sessions to include
- Focus on relevant synthesis examples and techniques
- Avoid interference from unrelated creative work
- Maintain control over synthesis direction

## Synthesis Techniques

### Concept Mapping
- Visual representation of idea relationships
- Identify central themes and peripheral concepts
- Map dependencies and reinforcing connections
- Find gaps and opportunities for integration

### Feature Matrix Analysis
- Compare features and capabilities across ideas
- Identify unique elements and common functions
- Create comprehensive feature sets from best elements
- Optimize for completeness and coherence

### Analogy Development
- Draw insights from other domains and industries
- Apply successful patterns from different contexts
- Use biological, mechanical, or social analogies
- Find unexpected sources of integration inspiration

### Constraint Integration
- Combine ideas while respecting implementation constraints
- Find creative ways to merge conflicting requirements
- Use limitations to drive innovative combinations
- Balance idealism with practical feasibility

## Cross-Domain Applications

### Technology Transfer
- Apply solutions from other technical domains
- Adapt successful patterns from different industries
- Leverage scientific principles and natural systems
- Find innovative applications of existing technologies

### Cultural Integration
- Combine approaches from different cultural contexts
- Adapt solutions for different user populations
- Integrate diverse perspectives and methodologies
- Respect cultural sensitivities in solution design

### Temporal Synthesis
- Combine historical approaches with modern capabilities
- Adapt traditional solutions with contemporary technology
- Learn from past innovations and future trends
- Balance proven methods with emerging possibilities

## Quality Assessment

### Coherence Evaluation
- Ensure synthesized solution is logically consistent
- Check for internal conflicts and contradictions
- Verify that combined elements work well together
- Maintain clarity and understandability

### Implementation Feasibility
- Assess practical viability of synthesized solution
- Consider resource requirements and constraints
- Evaluate technical complexity and risks
- Plan phased implementation if needed

### Innovation Potential
- Measure novelty and creative value of synthesis
- Assess potential impact and differentiation
- Evaluate market or user value proposition
- Consider scalability and future development

## Execution
1. Analyze input concepts and identify synthesis opportunities
2. Apply selected approach and pattern recognition focus
3. Leverage memory for successful combination patterns
4. Generate synthesized solutions using integration techniques
5. Evaluate coherence, feasibility, and innovation potential
6. Refine and optimize synthesized approach
7. Store successful synthesis patterns for future use

## Claude Code Integration
- Uses Memory MCP for pattern library and successful combinations
- Leverages Sequential for systematic synthesis processes
- Applies Context7 for cross-domain examples and analogies
- Auto-activates synthesizer persona for integration focus
